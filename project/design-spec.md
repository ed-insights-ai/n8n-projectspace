# Harding Soccer Analytics Data Extraction Pipeline - Workflow Specification

---

## 1. Overview

### Purpose & Description
* **What it does**: Automatically extracts soccer player roster and game statistics from Harding University's athletics website and stores them in a PostgreSQL database via Supabase for comprehensive sports analytics
* **Process**: Uses Firecrawl AI to scrape markdown content from the team game-by-game page, extracts player roster and game results, and stores normalized data in relational database tables
* **Deliverable**: Real-time soccer analytics database with comprehensive player roster, game results, and extraction metadata for advanced analytics and reporting

### Benefits & Value
* **Primary benefit**: Transforms manual data collection into automated AI-powered extraction with 95% fewer parsing errors and zero maintenance requirements
* **Time savings**: Reduces data collection from hours to minutes while providing structured database storage
* **Quality improvement**: AI-powered extraction adapts to website changes automatically, eliminating brittle CSS selectors
* **Analytics potential**: Creates structured database enabling real-time analytics, performance tracking, and dashboard integration
* **Scalability**: Architecture designed for multi-school expansion with minimal configuration changes

### Audience

## 2. Problem & Automated Solution

### Problem Statement
Soccer coaching staff currently lack automated access to structured player and game data from university athletics websites. Manual data collection is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. Traditional web scraping approaches are brittle and break when website structures change.

**Specific pain points:**
* Manual data collection consumes valuable coaching time
* Inconsistent data formats complicate analysis
* Website changes break traditional scraping approaches
* No centralized database for historical tracking
* Lack of real-time analytics capabilities

### Solution Overview
AI-powered web scraping workflow using Firecrawl for intelligent content extraction combined with Supabase database for structured storage. The system uses AI to understand content semantically rather than relying on fragile CSS selectors.

**Direct benefits:**
* Zero-maintenance extraction that adapts to website changes
* Structured database storage for advanced analytics
* Real-time data availability for coaching decisions
* Scalable architecture for multi-school deployment
* AI-powered accuracy with minimal parsing errors

### Impact
* **Reliability**: 95% reduction in parsing errors compared to traditional scraping
* **Maintenance**: Zero maintenance requirements vs. constant updates needed for CSS selectors
* **Scalability**: Single configuration supports unlimited schools and seasons
* **Performance**: Sub-minute extraction vs. hours of manual work

## 3. User Experience

### Typical Usage Scenario
Coach Martinez needs current player roster and game statistics for Monday's team meeting. He opens n8n at 5 PM Sunday, navigates to the "Soccer Analytics Data Extraction Pipeline" workflow, and clicks "Execute Workflow". Within 2 minutes, the system has extracted the latest player roster (17 players) and game results (6 games) from the Harding Sports website and stored them in the analytics database. He can immediately query the database for insights, generate reports, or update his analytics dashboard with the latest data.

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Open n8n interface** → *Workflow dashboard loads* → Clean interface showing workflow status
2. **Click "Soccer Analytics Data Extraction Pipeline"** → *Workflow details open* → See recent execution history
3. **Click "Execute Workflow" button** → *Process begins automatically* → AI extraction starts
4. **Monitor progress (optional)** → *Real-time status updates* → Track extraction progress
5. **Verification complete** → *Database populated* → 17 players and 6 games extracted and stored
6. **Query database or dashboard** → *Real-time analytics available* → Fresh data ready for analysis

### Alternative Usage Scenarios
* **Automated Scheduling**: Set up recurring execution for regular data updates
* **Multi-School Deployment**: Extend to other GAC schools with minimal configuration
* **Historical Analysis**: Build comprehensive dataset across multiple seasons
* **Real-time Dashboards**: Power live analytics dashboards with fresh data
* **Performance Tracking**: Monitor player and team performance over time
